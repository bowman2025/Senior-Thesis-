# Thesis Analysis: Candidate Identity and Economic Populism in Rural America

## Project Overview

This repository contains the R script and supporting documentation used for data analysis in my undergraduate honors thesis:

**Title**: Of the Land, For the People: Candidate Identity and Economic Populism in Rural America â€“ How the Democratic Party Can Gain Support Among White Rural Voters
**Author**: Bailey Bowman  
**Institution**: Haverford College  
**Date**: April 2025  
**Majors**: Political Science & English

The thesis explores how white rural voters respond to different Democratic candidates and messages, focusing on candidate identity (e.g., rural or working-class background) and economic populist messaging. The analysis is based on an original survey conducted in early 2025, alongside qualitative interviews.
